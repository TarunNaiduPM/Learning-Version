This repository is just for my experiments and learning with Git and GitHub. Nothing important or serious here!

## About

- Pushing random files as I test Git commands and features.
- You might find test scripts, notes, and temporary files.
- No official project or documentation—just a sandbox for practice.

## Usage

Feel free to browse or clone, but don’t expect anything useful.
